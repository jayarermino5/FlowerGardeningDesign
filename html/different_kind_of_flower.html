            <p style="padding:15px;">A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure
                found in
                flowering plants (plants
                of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to
                affect
                reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate
                outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing
                (fusion of
                sperm and egg from the same flower).</p>

                        color wherever they go.
                        The show lasts from late spring until the first frost in fall. Butterflies and hummingbirds are
                        attracted to the cheery flowers that bloom in nearly every bright color imaginable. They grow
                        quickly and reliably, making them a great choice for first-time flower growers. Add in their
                        low maintenance requirements and the variety of sizes and shapes, and you can’t lose.

                    <p class="text-justify">Sunflowers are iconic, all-American plants grown by gardeners in every
                        state. One of the easiest flowers to grow, Helianthus thrive in full sun and aren’t picky about
                        soil. You’re probably most familiar with the giant types that grow very tall and have oversized
                        yellow flowers. But there are many other types of sunflowers to explore.<br><b>
                            <h5>DESIGN IDEAS FOR SUNFLOWERS</h5>
                        </b>
                        Grow them as a joyful addition to the late-summer garden. They look great in the back of the
                        border or along a fence or wall.
                        Add them to your cutting garden and use them in arrangements. Look for sunflowers that are
                        pollenless and have sturdy stems.
                        Use them to attract birds, bees and butterflies-they are great for pollinators while in bloom,
                        and their seed heads can be dried and set out for the birds during winter.
                        Plant them as a companion plant in vegetable gardens. The sunflower is the fourth sister that
                        Native Americans used to accompany corn, beans and squash.
                        Grow sunflowers to inspire, delight and educate children. Kids are amazed at how quickly they
                        grow and how enormous the giant types become.</p>

                    <h3>IMPATIENS FLOWERS</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        For years, impatiens were my go-to annual for the shade garden because they bloom like mad and
                        come in a wide array of bright, eye-popping colors. And then one summer not so long ago, the
                        blooming stopped. In a matter of weeks, my newly planted bed of Impatiens walleriana turned
                        into a pitiful mass of defoliated stems—a victim of downy mildew.

                        In almost no time, many nurseries were forced to stop carrying them to prevent the spread of
                        the disease, and filled the void with the more resilient New Guinea impatiens. The good news
                        is, these indispensable shade annuals are back in abundance thanks to the development of new
                        hybrids that have been bred to fend off downy mildew—and better disease resistance isn’t the
                        only breakthrough. You’ll also find them in more flower and foliage colors than ever before.

                        Morning glory vines bring old-fashioned charm and a quaint cottage feeling to any garden.
                        However, if you don’t have time to take care of an aggressively seeding plant, you might want
                        to think twice about introducing them into your garden, as they can get out of hand in a hurry.
                        If you have a space where they can run wild over a fence, pergola or arbor, they will make
                        quick cover of it. Their funnel or tubular-shaped flowers open in the morning and close in the
                        afternoon. If you’re up for the challenge, here’s more information on growing morning glories.

                    <h3>LUPINE FLOWERS OFFER VIVID COLOR</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        If you’re looking for a showy summer-flowering perennial that will stand out from the crowd,
                        lupine is a sure front-runner. The tall, lush spires of vividly colored flowers are like floral
                        traffic cones, compelling you to slow down and take notice. In addition to their irresistible
                        beauty, lupines are also valued for their ability to flourish in challenging environments,
                        including sandy nutrient-poor soils, high elevations, and areas with cool summers.

                        “Just being able to grow lupines would be reason enough to move to a cool-summer climate,” says
                        Larry Hodgson, author of Perennials for Every Purpose. “Not only do lupines thrive, but they
                        self-sow with a vengeance.”

                        But relocating isn’t the only option for gardeners who want to plant these not-so-southern
                        belles in hotter regions of the country. Many varieties can be grown as annuals outside of
                        their comfort zone. And because lupine seeds are inexpensive, even the most frugal gardener can
                        afford to plant them every season

                        Daylily plants are one of the most popular low-maintenance perennials. They are tough,
                        long-lived and tolerant of neglect. They bloom profusely, though individual blooms only last a
                        day. Varieties number in the tens of thousands, but the most well-known is ‘Stella de Oro’ with
                        bright golden yellow flowers that bloom from spring until fall. Daylilies grow from fleshy
                        roots, unlike true lilies that grow from bulbs.

                        dahlias
                        are easy to grow and bring life to your garden. Dahlias like well-balanced and composted soil,
                        and
                        full sun. With 42 different species and thousands of cultivars, dahlias offer plenty of
                        variety.
                        Variations in color, flower form, size, and foliage make it easy to find one you'll love.
