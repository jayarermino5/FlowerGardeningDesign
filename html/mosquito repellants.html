                        <h2>1.&nbsp;LAVENDER</h2><br>
                        <p style="font-size:17px;">Lavender is a tough, dependable woody perennial that will last for
                            several years under the
                            right conditions. Because of its Mediterranean origin, lavender loves blazing hot sun and
                            dry soil. If your lavender doesn’t thrive, it’s most likely due to overwatering, too much
                            shade, and high humidity levels.

                            English lavenders and their hybrids are the best varieties for cooler climates, since they
                            are cold hardy north to Zone 5. However, they will grow best in a sheltered location with
                            winter protection. For southern gardens in extremely hot, humid climates, Spanish and
                            French lavenders are more tolerant of the moist conditions, but should be spaced apart to
                            allow good air circulation.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:17px;">Marigolds, an easy-to-grow annual flower, emit a smell that deters
                            mosquitoes. Grow them in
                            pots and place them near your patio or entrance to your home to keep bugs out. Marigolds
                            are also a popular addition to borders and vegetable gardens. According to NYBG, not only
                            can they keep away mosquitoes, but they also dissuade aphids, thrips, whiteflies, Mexican
                            bean beetles, squash bugs, and tomato hornworms.Calendula, also called pot marigold, is not
                            related to the common yellow and orange marigolds that most people know, but is an herb
                            often grown for medicinal purposes. Mexican tarragon (Tagetes lucida) is related, but is
                            mainly grown for culinary as well as medicinal uses. Mexican marigold (T. lemmonii) is also
                            related, but is an evergreen shrub</p>

                        <p style="font-size:17px;">Known for its distinct smell, citronella grass is the most commonly
                            used natural ingredient
                            in mosquito repellants. In fact, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden recommends lemon-scented
                            plants such as citronella grass to keep mosquitoes at bay. And the good news is that the
                            living plant is the most effective at repelling pests. This low maintenance plant does best
                            in large planters because it cannot withstand frost, but in warmer climates, can be planted
                            directly a sunny area in the ground. Also, when buying Citronella, make sure you buy
                            Cybopogon nardus or Citronella winterianus, which are true varieties.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:17px;"> Catnip (catmint) can be found thriving almost anywhere. It is from
                            the mint family and
                            grows
                            abundantly both as a commercial plant and as a weed. It is very easy to take care of and
                            may even start to invade other areas of your garden. However, if you are willing to forgo
                            this plant’s insidious nature, they are amazing mosquito repellants and another
                            recommendation from the BBG. In a study at Iowa State University, catmint was found to be
                            ten times more effective than DEET, the chemical used in most insect repellants.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:17px;">Want to attract good bugs like bees and butterflies, while deterring
                            the bad ones? Then bee
                            balm, also known as Monarda or horsemint, is the plant for you. Simply crush its leaves to
                            release the fragrant oils. Plus, you’ll get to enjoy colorful flowers, in shades of red,
                            pink, lavender, white, or purple, all summer long.
                            One of the best plants for attracting and supporting wildlife is bee balm, which blooms
                            throughout the summer. Also known as horsemint, Oswego tea, and bergamot, the flower nectar
                            provides sustenance for pollinating insects such as bees, butterflies, moths; as well as
                            hummingbirds, while the seed heads are a food source for songbirds during fall and winter.</p>

                        <p style="font-size:17px;">Another great mosquito repellant is rosemary. Both the New York
                            Botanical Garden and
                            PlantShed recommended this plant. Rosemary is an herb that many of us are very familiar
                            with and their woody scent is exactly what keeps mosquitoes as well as cabbage moths and
                            carrot flies away. They do best in hot and dry climates and thrive in containers, which may
                            be ideal for areas with winters. They can also be pruned into all sorts of shapes and sizes
                            and make great borders or decorations. While the pests stay away you can enjoy the herb’s
                            scent and also use it to season your cooking.

                            Ageratum is grown for its whimsical pompom-shaped flowers that occur mostly in shades of

                            plants are most often purchased as nursery starts in tray packs or flats, but can also be
                            grown from seed. With sizes ranging from a few inches high to three feet tall, ageratum can
                            be grown in containers, used as edging along pathways or borders, or massed in displays.</p>
